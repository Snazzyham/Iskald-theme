## Instructions for Starship

I just put my whole starship config file in here in case you want to use my prompt as well. If you have your own prompt and just like the colors, copy the `[palettes.iskald]` section from mine and paste it into yours, set `palette=iskald` on the top of the file, and then use the colors throughout your prompt. Refer to my file as an example.
